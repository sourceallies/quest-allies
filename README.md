# quest-allies
A repo for capturing changes to the Source Allies [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/what-is-dnd) universe.

## How To
We are still figuring out how exactly we want to document and organize this, but here are some high level guidelines.

## World Design Approach
- Ruleset: [D&D 5e](https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)
- Base Setting: [Forgotten Realms](https://dnd.wizards.com/story/lore/forgotten-realms) [map](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/dnd/resources/Sword-Coast-Map_HighRes.jpg)
- Design Style: Inside Out, only create what you need or the players experience. This helps to prevent pigon holing and give max flexibility to the DMs.

### Avoiding Spoilers
- Only commit to this repo what is public knowledge for all players and dungeon masters.
- For things that have not been revealed yet, fork the repo and document your adventure / campaign info.

### Adding to / Updating the world
Once the players have revealed something, or you have information the players can have before the game session, create a PR back to this repo so the other DM's can incorporate what your party had done and how the world had grown.

### IMPORTANT!!!
- Keep this fun, the world building should be as much fun as the gaming session. Collaborate and bounce ideas off of each other!
